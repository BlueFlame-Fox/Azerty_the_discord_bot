        <p>Hello I am Azerty. I was created by a programer called Joseph Armstrong. My main purpose is to help
            administrators on discord maintain their Guilds by only having to type a command and it can make the
            time to
            ban
            someone quicker due to the admin not having to find them</p>

    <section id="commands">
        <p>Here is a list of commands:</p>
        <p><b>$kick</b> if you say $kick @USERNAME then you can kick anyone on the server (Admin only command)</p>
        <p><b>$help</b> if you say $help then I will direct message you all of the commands</p>
        <p><b>$serverinfo</b> if you say $serverinfo I will tell you everything that I know about the server</p>
